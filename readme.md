# 🧠 **GOAP** 🎉

## What is this madness?

If you’ve ever wanted your NPCs to stop being headless chickens and make decisions like a semi-functional adult (or at least a squirrel with a plan), you’re in the right place!

Welcome to a wild ride through the basics of **GOAP (Goal-Oriented Action Planning)**, where your friendly AI agents will decide not just *what* to do, but *how* to do it, all while looking surprisingly competent!

This project is the first step toward world domination… or maybe just getting your AI to actually finish cooking their virtual food before the fire goes out. 🥘🔥

The goal? **Understanding the basics of GOAP** so you can experiment, tweak, break things, and eventually create NPCs that *almost* act like real people. Why? Because we can, that's why! 😎

## 🤖 Project Overview

This is a GOAP crash course (at least for me), designed to help you dive headfirst into the wonderful world of AI planning systems. With this project, you’ll learn how to:

- Set **goals** for your agents (from "gather wood" to "cook food" to "run away from the terrifying spider" 🕷️).
- Define **actions** with fancy stuff like preconditions and effects, because NPCs like to feel smart, too.
- See how our agents deal with a *dynamic world* where their goals might change halfway through (like when they suddenly realize there’s a boss fight looming... 😱).

With this foundational setup, you'll be ready to start building more complex behaviors, like NPCs that can navigate chaotic environments, handle unexpected events, or even develop a love for firewood gathering (hey, we don’t judge their hobbies!).

## 📦 Installation & Requirements

To run this glorious GOAP experiment, you don’t need anything fancy—just your average **Python** environment and a dash of curiosity!

### Step 1: Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheRealMarvin/GOAP.git
cd GOAP
```

### Step 2: Install the (minimal) requirements
Because we believe in simplicity, this should be a breeze. You can run the whole thing with default Python—no exotic libraries, no 42-step installation guides, just the basics!

### Step 3: Run the show!
```bash
python goap_simulator.py
```
Sit back, relax, and enjoy as your NPCs plan their next move in a world filled with virtual dilemmas and questionable choices. Who knows? Maybe they’ll even succeed!
